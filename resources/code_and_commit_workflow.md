# Code & Commit Workflow

This workflow should help as you add things to your site. It is best to commit often and once you have something working. If you code in large chunks without committing, it is harder to fix issues.

### Coding
* Write/Edit Code in Atom
  * MAKE SURE YOU SAVE
* View locally by opening index.html
* Repeat until satisfied

### Committing
* Switch to Github Desktop
* View Uncommitted Changes
* Fill in title/description
* Commit to Master
* Sync in top right corner
* view on username.github.io
